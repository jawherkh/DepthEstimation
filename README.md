# Depth Estimation
Depth estimation determines the distance of objects from a viewpoint, crucial for applications like autonomous driving, augmented reality, and 3D reconstruction. This project uses the DPT model for depth estimation and Gradio for creating an interactive demo.


## Setup To set up the working environment, install the necessary packages: 
```bash
pip install transformers gradio timm torchvision
```
## Applications
- Depth estimation is used in:

- Autonomous driving

- Augmented reality

- Robotics

- 3D reconstruction

- Medical imaging
